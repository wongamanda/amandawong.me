        <h3>A tinkerer, analyst, and what Saul Bellow calls a "first-class noticer"</h3>

        <h6>From growth marketing, flexible data visualizations, civic tech projects, teaching coding to high schoolers, art historical research, to dogwalking,
          I've done a lot and have enjoyed learning about it all.</h6>

        <h5>3 key takeaways about me:</h5>
          <h6><strong>1) The devil's in the details. &#x1F4F8;</strong>
          <br>I tackle big-picture objectives by paying attention to the essentials. I believe that great products
          anticipate needs that the user didn't realize she had. When I get onboard with a project, I
          get to tinkering. I read the literature, roll up my sleeves, and get messy with the tools. It's my favorite way to understand
          something inside and out, and strategize how to make it better.</h6>

          <h6><strong>2) I'm an analyst at heart. &#x1F4CA;</strong>
          <br>Statistics and Art History might seem like an odd couple, but their combination challenges me to think abstractly and within social contexts.
          I really enjoy exploring and understanding data to understand cultural patterns and make decisions that better serve audiences.</h6>

          <h6><strong>3) I like the unconventional. &#x1F32E;</strong>
          <br>For me, playing the game a little differently than everyone else can unlock great discoveries.
          My favorite taco place in the city isn't the one that media outlets write about but the one next door.
          Though it doesn't have much signage, it's uncrowded, their waitstaff unhurried, and you get complimentary chips & salsa while you wait for your meal.
          An all-around winner in my book.</h6>
