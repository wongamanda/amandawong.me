        <h3>A tinkerer, analyst, and what Saul Bellow calls a "first-class noticer"</h3>

        <h6>From growth marketing, flexible data visualizations, civic tech projects, teaching coding to high schoolers, art historical research, to dogwalking,
          I've done a lot and have enjoyed learning about it all.</h6>

        <h5>3 key takeaways about me:</h5>
          <h6><strong>1) The devil's in the details. &#x1F4F8;</strong>
          <br>I tackle big-picture objectives by paying attention to the essentials. When I get onboard with a project,
          I read the literature, roll up my sleeves, and get messy with the tools. It's my favorite way to understand
          something inside and out, and strategize how to make it better.</h6>

          <h6><strong>2) I'm an analyst at heart. &#x1F4CA;</strong>
          <br>Statistics and Art History might seem like an odd couple, but their combination challenges me to think abstractly and within social contexts.
          I really enjoy using data to understand cultural patterns and make decisions that better serve users.</h6>

          <h6><strong>3) I like the unconventional. &#x1F32E;</strong>
          <br>For me, playing the game a little differently than everyone else can unlock great discoveries.
          My favorite taco place isn't the most popular one â€” it's the one next door.
          It doesn't have much signage, but it's uncrowded, their waitstaff is unhurried, and you get complimentary chips & salsa while you wait.
          An all-around winner in my book.</h6>
